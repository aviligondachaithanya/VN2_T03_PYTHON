Python Loops
-----------------------

The looping simplifies the complex problems into the easy ones. 
It enables us to alter the flow of the program so that instead of 
writing the same code again and again, we can repeat the same code 
for a finite number of times. 

For example, if we need to print the first 10 natural numbers then, 
instead of using the print statement 10 times, 
we can print inside a loop which runs up to 10 iterations.

Iteration:iterator is a general term for taking each item of something one after and another.anytime you use
a loop explict or implict to go over a group of items that is iteration.

print(1)


print(10)
Advantages of loops
There are the following advantages of loops in Python.
1.It provides code re-usability.
2.Using loops, we do not need to write the same code again and again.
3.Using loops, we can traverse over the elements of data structures (array or linked lists).

Traverse:It is a process to visit all the nodes of a tree and may print their values too.


There are the following loop statements in Python.

1.for loop
-------------------------
The for loop is used in the case where we need to execute some part of the code 
until the given condition is satisfied. 
It is better to use for loop if the number of iteration is known in advance.

2.while loop
-----------------------
The while loop is to be used in the scenario where we don't know the number of iterations in advance. 
The block of statements is executed in the while loop until the condition specified in the while loop is satisfied. 
It is also called a pre-tested loop.

3.do-while loop	
------------------------
The do-while loop continues until a given condition satisfies. 
It is also called post tested loop. It is used when it is necessary to execute 
the loop at least once (mostly menu driven programs).
