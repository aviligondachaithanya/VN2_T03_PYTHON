Basic Operations:  Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division
Addition        :   Usecase: 2 + 3 = 5   
                                Scenarios :  2 + 3 + 6 = 11 
                                             -2 + 5    = 3
           
Subtraction     :   2 - 3 = -1
                   -2 - 5 = -7
             
Multiplication  :   2 X 3 = 6
                   -5 X 3 = -15
                   
Division        :   21 / 4 = quotient 5,remainder 1
                   -20 / 3 = quotient -6, remainder -2
10 (220+100/39)

BODMAS Principle:

Brackets      :  ()  
Of            :  power of 
              :  percent of 
              :  fraction of  
Division      :  %

Addition      :  +
Subtraction   :  - 

x = 2*(3*2)+23-34
Comparison :
------------ --
=    : x = 10
==   :   When two values are equal,we use the "equals" sign
          Ex: 2+2 == 4
≠    :   When two values are definitely not equal,we use the "not equal to" sign
          Ex: 2+2 ≠ 9

<	 :   When one value is smaller than another,we can use a "less than" sign.
          Ex: 3 < 5
≤    :   less than or equal to

>    :   When one value is bigger than another,we can use a "greater than" sign
          Ex: 9 > 6
≥    :   greater than or equal to

Symbol     Words            Example Use
==          equals           1 + 1 == 2  ==> True
≠          not equal to     1 + 1 ≠ 1  ==> True
>          greater than     5 > 7      ==> False
<          less than        7 < 9      ==> True
≥          greater than or 
           equal to         money ≥ 1
≤          less than or 
           equal to         bill ≤ 3
           
Combining:
----------
Example: Becky starts with $10, buys something and says "I got change, too". How much did she spend?
Answer: Something greater than $2 and less than $10 (but NOT $2 or $10):
        "What Becky Spends" > $2
        "What Becky Spends" < $10
        This can be written down in just one line:
        ===>  $2 < "What Becky Spends" < $10

That says that $0 is less than "What Becky Spends" (in other words "What Becky Spends" is greater than $0) and 
what Becky Spends is also less than $10.

Notice that ">" was flipped over to "<" when we put it before what Becky spends. 
Always make sure the small end points to the small value.

Changing Sides:
---------------
This:	 	                Becky Spends > $0	 	(Becky spends greater than $0)
is the same as this:	 	$0 < Becky Spends	 	($0 is less than what Becky spends)

An Example Using Algebra:
------------------------
Example: What is x+3, when we know that x is greater than 11?
         If x > 11 , then x+3 > 14
