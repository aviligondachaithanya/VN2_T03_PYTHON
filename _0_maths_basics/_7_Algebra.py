Expression : An expression is a number, a variable, 
             or a combination of numbers, variables and operation symbols.
             Ex: 4.5 + 1
                 2x + 3
                  
Equation   : Equation is made up of two expressions connected by an equal sign.
             Ex: 16 - 6 = 10
                 x + 8  = 40
                 3x + 4 = 5x + 14
                 L.H.S  = R.H.S     = vs == 
                 


Numeric expression   : It will contain all numbers.
                       To apply operations to numbers we can use this
                       Ex: 2(3 + 8) 
                           = 6 + 8 
                           = 14
                       
Algebraic expression : At least one variable and at least one operation
                       Ex: 2(x + 8y)


PROBLEM :
----------
Simplify the algebraic expression: 3(4x+5y)-2(3x-7y)

Then evaluate the simplified expression for x = 3 and y = -2.
            ==> Substitute the values,get final output

Then evaluate the simplified expression for x = 2/7 and y = 3/4.
            ==> Simplify the expression, then substitute the values 

Solution:
--------
Step 1: Simplify the algebraic expression using the basic properties of real numbers.
        = 3(4x+5y) - 2(3x-7y)
        = 3(4x+5y) + (-2)(3x+[-7]y)   <==  Definition of Subtraction
        = 12x + 15y + (-6)x + 14y     <==  Distributive property
        = 12x + (-6)x + 15y + 14y     <== Commutative property of Addition
        = (12+[-6])x + (15 + 14)y     <== Distributive property
        = 6x + 29y                    <== Simplify


Step 2: Now subustitute x with 3 and y with -2
        = 6(3) + 29(-2)
        = -40
        
PROBLEM :
----------        
Prove (a+b)² = a²+2ab+b²

Solution:
---------
Here LHS = (a+b)²
     RHS = a²+2ab+b²


(a+b)²  = (a+b)×(a+b)
        
        = (a+b)(a+b)
        
        = [a×(a+b)]+[b×(a+b)]
        
        = [a(a+b)]+[b(a+b)]
        
        = [{(a×a)+(a×b)}] + [{(b×a)+(b×b)}]
        
        = [(a²)+(ab)] + [(ba)+(b²)]
        
        = (a²)+(ab)+(ba)+(b²)
        
        = (a²)+(ab)+(ab)+(b²)   <== Since a×b = b×a (commutative property), ba = ab.
        
        = (a²)+(2×ab)+(b²)
        
        = a²+2ab+b²
        
        = RHS

 ∴  LHS = RHS
 Hence Proved
