Variable:
-------------------------


A Python variable is a reserved memory location to store values. 
In other words, a variable in a python program gives data to the computer for processing.
Every value in Python has a datatype. 



>>> x = 10 # dynamically typed programming language
>>> x
10
>>> print(x)
10
>>> x = 10   # write operation  CRUD - create - signup, retrieve-signin , update-, delete-item

	x = 100  create
	print(x) read/retrieve
	x = 200  update
	del(x)   delete



	LHS = RHS 
	x   -> variable  
	=   -> operator   
	10  -> value

 --> Here execution starts from RHS then to LHS
 --> Converts RHS to binary format
 --> assigning memory location
 --> address wil be reffered with variable
 
 
 >>> id(x)   # To get address of variable x referring to 
3170058201680
 
 >>> print(x)  # read operation
10
>>>


Number System:
---------------
>>> x = 10
>>> id(x)
3170058201680
>>> type(x)
<class 'int'>
>>>
>>> x = 10.5
>>> id(x)
3170071758480
>>> type(x)
<class 'float'>


Boolean:
------------
>>> x = True
>>> id(x)
140718478518376
>>> type(x)
<class 'bool'>
>>> print(x)
True
>>>


>>> x
10
>>> X
20
>>> x = 10
>>>
>>> y = 10
>>> Y
